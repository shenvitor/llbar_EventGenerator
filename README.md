# llbar_EventGenerator
Event generator for $\bar{p}+p \to \bar{\Lambda}+\Lambda$ and their decay particles $p$, $\pi^-$, and $\bar{p}$, $\pi^+$ that focus on angular and momentum distribution.

The event generator was benchmarked by studying angular distributions in final states, which are constructed by kinematic relations of 4-momentum vectors in different reference frames for all mother and daughter particles. 

Remark:
It is in the format of a root macro file which is run on ROOT.

Outlook:
It might be a good idea to develop this into a class in the future!
